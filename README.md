### About Me : Angie Ching Yi Kwan

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my master thesis on the post-Quebec Agreement nuclear bomb development during WWII (1943-45), and intrigued by their aftermaths and the roles of the related secret negotiations during an intense period of decolonisation that immediately followed (1946-50). 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enjoying learning about twentieth century history from areas including Latin America, Algeria, to Europe. Happy to make transcontinental connections and comparisons from a global history perspective!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on writing projects and articles, and also excited to hear about different opportunities! Feel free to reach out!

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with : How does the massive immigration to mastodon works out ? 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Travels, Museums, Cartoons and Animations!
